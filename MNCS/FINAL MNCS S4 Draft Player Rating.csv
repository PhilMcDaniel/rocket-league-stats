I have missed the pass two seasons due to family problems and a shift in priorities in life. I used to play a lot of rocket when i was at Alpine, but i took a big step back from it over the last 6 months. However, I am still in love with the sport (and more importantly the friends i play it with) and I'm pretty familiar with the MNCS community and would like to start competing again. I wouldn't say I have any lofty aspirations. I'm not trying to like start playing 6 hours a day again to hit SSL so i can be in MNCS again LOL. But I am a consistent GC (GC2 if I'm playing well) and would like to get into some higher lobbies again. Honestly, I'm just looking for a rocket league team that i can play the game more seriously with. I did just start a new job but that shouldn't interfere with scheduling cause i get off work at 5pm EST (4pm CST) so i could play as much as the team requires as long as its after then. I would also totally be able to come to LAN. I've been looking for an excuse to come back to MN for a while, and if i end up buying tickets before qualifying then i will just come spectate and see the community. I've been dying to meet some of the people in person. Sorry i know this was lengthy and thanks for letting me back in y'all! ",
